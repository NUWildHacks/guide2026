# Meals, Snacks, and Drinks

A hackathon is all about development. We want you to focus on that, so we'll provide you with meals, snacks, and drinks you need to keep you going. 😉

## Meal Distribution

Meals will be distributed at the times and locations listed on the [schedule](/schedule). Meals will generally be distributed on 1st Floor Mudd.

You can view our [meal options](/logistics/meal-options) to see what we have at each meal throughout the event.

  **You must have your [WildHacker Code](https://dashboard.wildhacks.net/code) ready and have submitted a project on Dev Post to receive meals. You can edit your project after submission 😊**

## Additional Food and Drinks

If you want different food or drinks than what we have available, there are vending machines located throughout the buildings. You can also order or pick up food from local restaurants. Note that all additional food and drink options must be purchased.
