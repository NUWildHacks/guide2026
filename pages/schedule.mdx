# WildHacks 2025 Schedule

See the [event map](/map) for location details. All WildHackers are provided work spaces in [Mudd Library](https://www.library.northwestern.edu/libraries-collections/mudd-library/) and the [Technological Institute](https://maps.northwestern.edu/txt/facility/132). If you are an out-of-town WildHacker, we recommend you *do not* leave these designated areas.

## (Optional) Workshop Week

<Callout emoji="👾">
Workshop Week is a hybrid, *optional* collaboration to introduce newer WildHackers to software development topics. We are grateful to Northwestern's computing student organizations for hosting these sessions! 💓
</Callout>

All times are in Central Time. Virtual options will be provided for all sessions to all registered WildHackers.
