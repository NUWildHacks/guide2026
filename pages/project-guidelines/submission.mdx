# Project Submission

Submission is done on [DevPost](https://wildhacks-2026.devpost.com/). [Teams](/project-guidelines/team-guidelines) of up to 4 are allowed to submit to one of 3 [tracks](/project-guidelines/tracks-and-challenges) that will be released when hacking begins.

<Callout type="error" emoji="🔥">
  Make sure your project submission abides by the [WildHacks Project
  Rules](/project-guidelines/rules). **Failure to do so may result in
  disqualification.**
</Callout>

## Round 1 Submission Requirements

All submissions must include **all** of the following:

- A link to a **public** GitHub repository containing all of your project's source code.
- A [showcase video](#showcase-video) **no longer than 2.5 minutes** showcasing your project.
- A written description of your project.

### Round 1 Showcase Video

Your demo video is the first thing judges see for your project, so make sure it's engaging and shows off why your project deserves to win! We recommend a structured approach to address our judging criteria:

- \~30 seconds: What problem your project is addressing, why it's important, and how your project solves it.
- \~30 seconds: What technologies your project uses (APIs, programming languages, frameworks, etc.).
- \~60 seconds: A demo that showcases the features of your project.

<Callout type="warning">
  For 2026, Round 1 videos are **highly discouraged** from extraneous video editing. We encourage WildHackers to focus on demonstrating their application.
