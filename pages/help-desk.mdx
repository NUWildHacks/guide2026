# WildHacks Help Desk

At all hours between **Saturday at 11:00 AM** and **Sunday at 1:30 PM**, there will be at least one WildHacks organizer available at the **WildHacks Help Desk** on the second floor of Mudd (see the [map](/map)). This includes overnight hours. If you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to stop by the help desk or ask on Discord.
